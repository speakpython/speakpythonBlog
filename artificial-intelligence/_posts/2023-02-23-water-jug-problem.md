A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.

## Here's the code

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build
the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but
the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and
auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


```python
print('Hello Wordl')
print(a)
```

## Here's the code

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the
convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter.
Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

```cpp
int main()
{
	int i = 0, count = 0, marks;
	while(i==0)
	{
		cout<<"Available Students Marks: (before insertion)"<<endl;
		display();
		count++;
		cout<<endl<<"Provide No. "<<count<<" Student Marks: ";
		cin>>marks;
		createnode(marks);
		display();
		cout<<endl<<"Press 0 to insert more or any num to exit: ";
		cin>>i;
	}
	cout<<"At the end we are having "<<count<<" students marks with us:"<<endl;
	display();
	return 0;
}
```
