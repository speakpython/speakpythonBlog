Ultimate challenge of human intelligence against artificial intelligence! 

Today, we will witness a battle of wits between a human and an `AI opponent` in one of the simplest yet most beloved games of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Tic-tac-toe and AI

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that has been played by generations of children and adults alike. It's a game that is easy to learn, but difficult to master. 

However, with the advent of AI (Artificial Intelligence), even the most skilled human players may find themselves struggling to keep up with their electronic counterparts.

## Tic-tac-toe in Python
<hr>


### Grid box pattern 

The `game_grid(value)` function takes a list value containing the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe game board as input.


```python
def game_grid(value):  
    print("\n")  
    print("\t____________________")  
    print("\t|      |      |     |")  
    print("\t|    {} |  {}   |  {}  |".format(value[0], value[1], value[2]))  
    print('\t|______|______|_____|')  
    print("\t|      |      |     |") 
    print("\t|   {}  |  {}   |  {}  |".format(value[3], value[4], value[5]))  
    print('\t|______|______|_____|')  
    print("\t|      |      |     |")  
    print("\t|  {}   |  {}   |  {}  |".format(value[6], value[7], value[8]))  
    print('\t|______|______|_____|')
    print("\n") 
```

- The function prints the __Tic-Tac-Toe game board__ using __ASCII__ art to display the current state of the game. 

- The function prints a __3x3__ grid with lines and pipes using the values in the value list to represent the __Xs__ and __Os__ on the board.

- The value list contains 9 elements representing the 9 positions on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

<br/>

### Possible winning patterns
The code defines a list called `winning_pattern` which contains sub-lists of all the possible winning combinations in a Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
<br/>

```python
winning_pattern = [
    
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9],
    [1,4,7],
    [2,5,8],
    [3,6,9],
    [1,5,9],
    [3,5,7]
    
]
```
<br/>

### Variables initialisation

These variables are used to keep track of the state of the game, including which positions on the board have been taken and by whom.

```python
taken_moves = []
default_values = [' ' for i in range(9)]
players_moves = {
    'X_moves': [],
    'O_moves': []
}
players = ['X', 'O']
```
>> notes to the code....

- `taken_moves = []`, creates an empty list to keep track of the positions on the board that have already been taken by the players.

- The second line, `default_values`, creates a list with 9 elements, each element initialized to a blank space character (' '). This represents the initial state of the game board.

- `players_moves` is a dictionary that keeps track of the moves made by each player.



<br/>

### Update Game state 

The `update_game` function updates the game state based on the player's move and returns a visual representation of the updated game board.

```python
def update_game(move, player):
    taken_moves.append(move)
    players_moves[player + '_moves'].append(move)
    default_values[move - 1] = player
    return game_grid(default_values)
```

- The `update_game()` takes two arguments: `move`, which is the __position__ on the board where the player has made their move, and __player__, which is either `X` or `O`, indicating which player made the move.

- It first adds the move to the `taken_moves` list, which keeps track of all positions on the board that have been taken.

- Next, the function appends the `move` to the list associated with the appropriate player in the `players_moves` dictionary.

- Also, updates the `default_values` list to reflect the new move made by the player, replacing the blank space at the `move - 1` __index__ with the player's symbol (`X` or `O`).

<br/>

### Decide winner 
On the basis of taken steps, recorded inside `players_moves` dictionary, `check_winning` will decide the winner.
<br/>

```python
def check_winning():
    for player in players_moves:
        for i in winning_pattern:
            if all(j in players_moves[player] for j in i):
                return player      
    return False
```

- The function checks if any of the sub-lists in `winning_pattern` is a _subset of `players_moves_`, which means the player has achieved a winning combination. If a _winning combination_ is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

<br/>

## How machine will play
<hr />

### AI First move
The `initial_move()` used to determine the first move made by the machine when playing tic-tac-toe against a human player.
<br/>

```python
def initial_move():
    #Acquire Center
    if 5 not in players_moves['X_moves']:
        return 5
    #Acquire any corner
    return random.choice([1,3,7,9])
```

- The function first checks if the center position (position __5__ on the board) is available. If it is, the function returns 5 as the machine's first move.

- If the center position is not available, the function randomly chooses _one of the four corner positions_ (positions __1, 3, 7, or 9__).

<br/>

### AI Smart move ü§ì

The `smart_move()` tries to find the best possible move for the player by analyzing the current state of the game and searching for potential winning slots.

```python
def smart_move(mine_move, opp_moves):
    next_move = []
    for i in winning_pattern:
        if not [x for x in mine_move if x in i]:
            for j in i:
                if j not in opp_moves:
                    next_move.append(j)
            if len(next_move) == 1:
                return next_move[0]
            next_move = []
    return False
```

- The function tries to find the _next best move for the player_ by examining a _pre-defined winning_pattern_ and looking for the next empty slot that the player could potentially use to win the game.

- First, it checks each pattern in the `winning_pattern` list to see if the player has any moves in that pattern. 

- If not, it then checks each slot in the pattern to see if the _opponent has already taken_ it. If the slot is still empty, the function adds it to the `next_move` list.

- If there is only _one possible next move_, the function __immediately__ returns that move. Otherwise, it clears the `next_move` list and moves on to the next pattern.

- If no move is found, the function returns `False`.

<br />

### AI Winning move üèÜ
The `winning_move()` checks if there is a possible winning move for the player and returns that move if there is, otherwise returns `None`.

```python
def winning_move():
    moves = smart_move(players_moves['X_moves'], players_moves['O_moves'])
    return moves if moves else None
```

- It calls the `smart_move()` with the `X_moves` and `O_moves` lists from the `players_moves` dictionary as arguments.

- If `smart_move` returns a move, _meaning there is a possible winning move_ for the player, `winning_move` returns that move. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

<br />

### AI Random Edge move
The `random_edge_move()` returns the first available edge slot on the board, _starting from the top-left and moving clockwise_, if there is one.

```python
def random_edge_move():
    for i in [2,4,6,8]:   
        if i not in taken_moves:
            return i
```

- It tries to find an empty slot by iterating over the list `[2,4,6,8]`, which represents the indices of the edge slots on the board.

- If the index is not in the `taken_moves` list, which contains all the moves already made by both players, the function returns that index.

- If there are no available edge slots, the function does not return anything.

<br />

## Driver Code - AI vs Human 
It plays a game between a human player (__X__) and the computer (__O__), using a combination of [_pre-defined strategies and randomness_](#ai-strategies) to determine the computer's moves.

```python
import random
step = 0
game_grid(default_values)
while step < 9 and step >= 0:

    if step >= 4:
        print('Match tied!')
        break
    
    player = "X"
    try:
        move = int(input(player + " : "))
        if move < 10 and move not in taken_moves:
            step += 1
            update_game(move,player)
            winner = check_winning() if step > 1 else None
            if winner:
                print(winner, 'Won!')
                break
            elif step == 1:
                O_move = initial_move()
            else:
                O_move = winning_move()
                O_move = smart_move(players_moves['O_moves'], players_moves['X_moves']) if not O_move else O_move
                O_move = random_edge_move() if not O_move else O_move
            print("O (Python üêç): ",O_move)
            player = "O"
            update_game(O_move, player)
            winner = check_winning() if step > 1 else None
            if winner:
                print(winner, 'Won!')
                break
            continue
        print("Invalid move! - either your move is too high or already taken.")
    except:
        print("Invalid move! - wrong input.")
```

>> brief explanation....

- The code initializes the game grid and a counter for the number of steps taken so far (`step`). 

- It enters a loop that continues until either _9 steps have been taken_ (i.e. the board is full) _or a winner has been determined_.

- If 4 or more steps have been taken and there is no winner, the game is declared a __tie__.

- The loop alternates between the human and computer player turns. For the human player, the code prompts the user for their move and updates the game board if the move is valid.

<br />
<hr />

#### AI strategies

For the computer player, [in sequence]

1. Use the [__`winning_move()`__](#ai-winning-move-) to find a potential winning move.
2. If there is no winning move, use the [__`smart_move()`__](#ai-smart-move-) to find a move that blocks the human player's potential winning moves.
3. If there is no winning or blocking move, use the [__`random_edge_move()`__](#ai-random-edge-move) to make a random move on an edge slot.

<hr />

<br >

- If a valid move is found, the computer player updates the game board and prints its move.

- After each move, the code checks if there is a winner. If there is, the loop is terminated and the winner is printed. Otherwise, the loop continues.

- If the human player inputs an invalid move, the code prints an error message and continues the loop.

<br />

### Example testing

- __X__ = Human Player
- __O__ = AI (Computer)

### Conclusion

In conclusion, playing tic-tac-toe against an AI opponent can be a fun and challenging experience. By combining pre-defined strategies and randomness, the AI can make smart and unpredictable moves that keep the game interesting. 

While it may be difficult to beat the AI, there are still opportunities for human players to outsmart it and win the game.
